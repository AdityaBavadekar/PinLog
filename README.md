# What is PinLog?
Using PinLog, you can store your logs in a sql database and also save them in a file on android without writing hundreds of lines of code. 
```kt
//Logs are automatically stored.
PinLog.logI("MainActivity","onCreate")

//Or create a report which contains 
//PinLogs, applicationInfo, BuildConfig if was 
//provided while initialisation and System logs.
PinLog.CrashReporter().createReport(thread,exception)

//Get stored logs 
PinLog.getAllPinLogsAsStringList() 

//Delete stored logs 
PinLogs.deleteAllPinLogs()
```

PinLog also supports Uncaught Exception Handling, which you can use like this :
```kt
PinLog.setupExceptionHandler(
toEmails = arrayOf("example@gmail.com"), 
message ="You can add additional comments 
in this email which may help us a lot.",
subject =  "Sorry MyApplication crashed, 
we will try better next time.")
```

PinLog is an easy-to-use and powerful android Logging Library. It is made by Aditya Bavadekar.

PinLog supports storing logs for later retrieval, saving logs in a file, saving logs in a zip file and more.

This project contains two modules i.e libraries namely  `pinlog` the main library and `pinlog-activity` the extension library.
The main library does not depend on the other library, so you can use it directly from dependency.

# What is pinlog-activity?
PinLog-Activity is
an extension library for PinLog usefull for debuging and finding bug by isolation of logs. 
 
Many times we have to debug apps by connecting the android 
device to pc just to view the logs from logcat.

Pinlog-activity is an on-device app which is installed 
with your application. When you open it you can
see all the pinlogs added by your app. You can
filter the logs according to their TAG property 
or sort them. You can also export all logs to a file with it.

# Implementation 

### Using Gradle : 
> Add `maven{  }` in your build.gradle(project)
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
      //Add this `maven` block
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
> Add the dependency
 ![TAG](https://jitpack.io/v/AdityaBavadekar/PinLog.svg)
```gradle
dependencies {
     // Refer the above badge for latest `TAG`.
    implementation 'com.github.AdityaBavadekar.PinLog:pinlog:TAG'
    //Or if you want a DebugLogsActivity for 
    //your app which shows list of logs add this instead
    debugImplementation 'com.github.AdityaBavadekar.PinLog:pinlog-activity:TAG'
    
}
```
### Using Maven : 
> Add `repository`
```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```
> Add the dependency
![TAG](https://jitpack.io/v/AdityaBavadekar/PinLog.svg)
```xml
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.AdityaBavadekar.PinLog</groupId>
	    <artifactId>pinlog</artifactId>
	    <version>TAG</version>
	</dependency>
```

```xml
<!--Or if you want a DebugLogsActivity for 
     your app which shows list of logs add this instead-->
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.AdityaBavadekar.PinLog</groupId>
	    <artifactId>pinlog-activity</artifactId>

# How do I use PinLog?

### Initialisation
 - PinLog should be initialised in the Application Class :
```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

         PinLog.initialise(this)
         PinLog.setDevLogging(true)//Optional
         PinLog.setBuildConfigClass(BuildConfig::class.java)//Optional
    }

}
```
*OR*
```kotlin
 //For Debuggable Builds
 PinLog.initialiseDebug(this@App)

 //For Release Builds
 PinLog.initialiseRelease(this@App)
```

### Usage
```kotlin

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        logI("onCreate")
        logW("This is a warning")
        logE("This is a error")
        logD("This is a debug log")
        //OR
        PinLog.logI("MainActivity","onCreate")
        PinLog.logW("MainActivity","This is a warning")
        PinLog.logE("MainActivity","This is a error")
        PinLog.logD("MainActivity","This is a debug log")

        //Get stored logs
        PinLog.getAllPinLogsAsStringList()
        //Delete stored logs
        PinLogs.deleteAllPinLogs()

    }

}
```


You can customise the log format 
by extending [`LoggingStyle`](https://github.com/AdityaBavadekar/PinLog/blob/master/pinlog/src/main/java/com/adityaamolbavadekar/pinlog/LoggingStyle.kt) class and 
configuring it with PinLog by calling 

```kt
PinLog.setLogFormatting(myCustomLoggingStyle)
```


But the default implementation that is in 
the class called as [`DefaultApplicationLoggingStyle`](https://github.com/AdityaBavadekar/PinLog/blob/master/pinlog/src/main/java/com/adityaamolbavadekar/pinlog/DefaultApplicationLoggingStyle.kt)
Which has output similar to this line.
